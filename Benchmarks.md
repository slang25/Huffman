# Benchmarks Over Time

## Les Mis√©rables

Average taken over 20 compression decompression cycles, in Debug build with debugger attached. 
This is to purposefully slow it down so that efficiency improvements are more noticable.

### First Benchmark

```
Compression:   382 ms
Decompression: 367 ms
```

### Second Benchmark

Removing division and modulus from BitReader class.
